    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It hides the internal state of an object and only exposes the necessary functionalities through methods. This helps in controlling access to the data and prevents unintended modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details while highlighting essential features. In OOP, abstraction allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. It provides a way to create user-defined data types (classes) with their own behaviors and characteristics, allowing users to interact with them without needing to understand their internal implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. Subclasses can extend the functionality of their superclass by adding new features or overriding existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and refers to the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors based on the context in which they are used. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables flexibility and extensibility in the design, as methods can be defined to operate on objects of the superclass, and the appropriate behavior is determined dynamically at runtime based on the actual type of the object."
